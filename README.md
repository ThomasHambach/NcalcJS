NCalc is a mathematical expressions evaluator in JavaScript/TypeScript. NCalc can parse any
expression and evaluate the result, including static or dynamic parameters and custom functions. You
may also want to look at the example running on CloudFlare workers

## Project Description

### Browser Support

In theory, all browsers supporting ECMAScript 5.1.

In practice, this target has been extensively tested against:

* Firefox 34.0.5
* Safari 8.0.2
* Chrome 39.0.2171
* Explorer 11.0.3

### Is NodeJS supported?

The package has been extensively tested against Node.js 14 LTS.


### Installation

Get the package from npm.org (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncalcjs) by running

    npm i --s ncalcjs

or with yarn

    yarn ncalcjs

### Usage

For documentation here is the table of content:

- [description](docs/description.md): overall concepts, usage and extensibility points
- [operators](docs/operators.md): available standard operators and structures
- [functions](docs/functions.md): list of already implemented functions
- [parameters](docs/parameters.md): on how to use parameters expressions

#### Basic

```typescript
import {Expression} from 'ncalcjs';
const e = new Expression('2 + 3 * 5');
console.log(e.Evaluate()); // 17
```

#### Custom Functions

The API compared to C# NCalc is a little different. In NCalcJS you define custom functions in the
following way. Each function is expected to be of the type `EvaluateFunctionHandler`.

```typescript
const e = new Expression('SecretOperation(3, 6)');

e.EvaluateFunction['SecretOperation'] = (args: FunctionArgs) => {
  args.Result = args.Parameters[0].Evaluate() + args.Parameters[1].Evaluate();
};
console.log(e.Evaluate()); // 9
```

#### Handling Errors

You can use the method `Expression.HasErrors()` to check for any errors that are present in your
expression. The errors details are stored in `Expression.errors`.

```typescript
import {Expression} from 'ncalcjs';
const e = new Expression('2 + 3 * 5');
if (e.HasErrors()) {
  console.error(e.errors);
}
```

### Known Issues

- `Round` does not return the correct value

## Building

Install all dependencies

    npm install

Before we can run our build, we need to install `ts-patch` that will change our `paths` configured
in `tsconfig.json`. Note that you have to run this every time after running `npm install`.

    npm run prepare

Build the distribution version

    npm run build

### ANTLR & Grammar

Note that the files, except for `NCalc.g4` in `/src/Grammar` are automatically generated. Any
changes you wish to make there are to be made in `NCalc.g4`. You will need Java runtime installed on
your system to generate these files.

To update the generated files, run this commond inside `/src/Grammar`.

    antlr4 -Dlanguage=TypeScript NCalc.g4
